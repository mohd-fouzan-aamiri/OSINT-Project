# OSINT-Project

I conducted a comprehensive analysis of Open-Source Intelligence (OSINT) to gather valuable insights about xyz organization and its employees. The objective was to utilize publicly available information to uncover actionable intelligence for various purposes, including threat detection, investigations, and decision-making.

This Project was done strictly for educational purpose only.
